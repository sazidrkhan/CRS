### Login Credentials

User credentials are stored in `data/LOGIN.txt`. The system supports multiple user roles:

- Academic Officer
- Lecturer
- Course Admin

### Data Management

The system uses text files for data persistence located in the `/data` directory:
- `students-abood.txt` - Student information
- `courses.txt` - Course catalog
- `enrollments.txt` - Course enrollment records
- `recovery_plans.txt` - Recovery plan data
- `GradedStudentRecords.txt` - Graded student records
- `notGradedStudentsRecords.txt` - Pending grade records
- `LOGIN.txt` - User authentication data

Reports are saved in the `/reports` directory in PDF format.
